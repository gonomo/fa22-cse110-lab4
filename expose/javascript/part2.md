1 - it will print the length of the array prices because it will print i which iterates through the array. The output is 3.

2 - it will print the discountedPrice of the last element in the array. The output here is 150.

3 - it wil print the final price after rounding the discountedPrice of the last element in the array. The output here is 150.

4 - the function will return an array of the final prices after the discount has been applied to the prices array. The return value here is [ 50, 100, 150 ].

5 - the code causes an error because the variable i is outside of the scope since it was declared using let inside the for loop.

6 - the code causes an error because because the variable discountedPrice is outside of the scope since it was declared using let inside the for loop.

7 - 3 - it wil print the final price after rounding the discountedPrice of the last element in the array. The output here is 150. It does not cause an error this time because finalPrice is inside the function scope where console.log was called.

8 - the function will return an array of the final prices after the discount has been applied to the prices array. The return value here is [ 50, 100, 150 ].

9 - the code causes an error because the variable i is outside of the scope since it was declared using let inside the for loop.

10 - it will return 3 because the length is equal to prices.length. prices.length is equal to 3. Thus, length is equal to 3 as well.

11 - this will return [ 50, 100, 150 ] since the discounted price gets redeclared each time we go through the loop.

12 - 

A - student["name"] or student.name

B - student["Grad Year"]

C - student.greeting()

D - student["Favorite Teacher"].name or student["Favorite Teacher"]["name"]

E - student["courseLoad"][0] or student.courseLoad[0]

13 - 

A - 32

B - 1

C - 3

D - 3null

E - 4

F - 0

G - 3undefined

H - NaN

14 -

A - true

B - false

C - true

D - false

E - false

F - true

15 - == converts the variable to the same type before comparision. However, === does not. So for === it has to have the same type and value for it to be true.

17 - the result will be [ 2, 4, 6 ] the function modifyArray takes each element of array and push it after calling callback on the element. The callback here is doSomething, which multiplies the number parameter by two and then return it.

19 -

2 is printed after one second
